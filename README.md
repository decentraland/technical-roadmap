# Decentraland Technical Roadmap

This project uses Excalidraw + Dataweave to generate an SVG of the roadmap + its current state.

The decision of using excalidraw was made to leverage the visual studio code extensions and to have a versioned working file that we can track back in time using commits.

The decision of using Dataweave is simply because it gets the job done with very low loc and effort.

The information used to render the progress bars comes from the Github Issue API. It counts the check boxes (tasklist) of the issues to track progression.

All elements in the technical roadmap are (or should be) public issues.
